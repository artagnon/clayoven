How to write content for clayoven

(This is a header.  The first line enclosed in parentheses.)

Welcome.  Let me describe how to write content for clayoven [1].  Care
has been taken to ensure that the input [2] and output (i.e. this
page) are as close to each other as possible.

Paragraphs can be written as you would write them in emails, wrapped
to 80 characters.  Hard line-breaks will be removed and the html page
will wrap lines.

Links are footnoted, and cannot be inlined: this is a feature.

Lists are automatic.

1. I'll show some source code here, and then continue to the next
   point as if nothing happened.

    static int ce_compare_data(struct cache_entry *ce)
    {
    	int match = -1;
    	int fd = open(".git/cache", O_RDONLY);
    
    	if (fd >= 0) {
    		unsigned char sha1[20];
    		if (!index_fd(sha1, fd, OBJ_BLOB))
    			match = hashcmp(sha1, ce->sha1);
    		/* index_fd() closed file descriptor */
    	}
    	return match;
    }

- This is an unordered list.

4. Note that my numbering doesn't have to be consistent either.

  This is a simple paragraph indent.

If you do want hard-line breaks, you can get that. 
Just put one trailing whitespace at the end of the line.

That's about it.  I really don't need anything else.
