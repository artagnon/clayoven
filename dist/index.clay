clayoven

The [README](https://github.com/artagnon/clayoven/blob/master/README.md) should get you warmed up, and [this](/scratch) hidden test page should show you the output of [scratch.index.clay](/scratch.index.clay); keep it around for handy reference.

The full rdoc documentation is available at [clayoven.artagnon.com](https://clayoven.artagnon.com)

Enjoy using clayoven!
